# PhantomJS-Raspberry-Pi-3-
PhantomJS compiled on a Raspberry Pi 3, working binary ready to download and run.

##Directions 
-Unzip phantomjs.zip (note this is zipped because I couldn't upload it to github otherwise and you need the compiled binary which still takes many hours on a Raspberry Pi 3 to do).

###Directions to run
- Without direct installation you will have to run the full directory of the location
- /{current working directory}/phantomjs -arg1 

Problems? Please let me know.
